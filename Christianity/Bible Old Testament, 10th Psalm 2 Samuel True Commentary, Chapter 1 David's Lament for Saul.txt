Bible Old Testament, 10th Psalm 2 Samuel True Commentary, Chapter 1 David's Lament for Saul
Taishan Taoist Understanding Religion

(1) (1) "Jesus Christ" was "crucified" by the Jewish group for calling the Jewish priests "hypocritical scribes and blind leaders" and for overthrowing the Jewish "Old Testament era" to open the "New Testament era". The "crucifixion" of the Jewish group for overthrowing the Jewish "Old Testament era" and opening the "New Testament era" is evidence that the Jewish group is a demonic group. The inclusion of the Jewish classic Old Testament in the Christian Bible is a "textbook and touchstone" for Christians to open their eyes to Christ. (2) The Old Testament is the classic of the demonic group Judaism, which was overthrown by "Jesus Christ", and it is through the study of the Old Testament that we discover why Jesus called the Jewish priests "hypocritical scribes and blind leaders" and who found Whoever finds the reason why "Jesus Christ" rebuked the Jewish priests is the Christ who has "eyes like a flame".
(3) If you do not find the reason why "Jesus Christ" rebuked the Jewish priests, and if you practice the words and actions of the Jewish priests as if they were "Christian doctrine", then you are a devil's minion who has gone astray and has made a thief his father. (4) The first book of the Old Testament, Genesis, is a classic that predates "Judaism" and later became a "Jewish classic", so do not think that Genesis is a "Jewish classic". Therefore, one should not think that Genesis is a "Jewish classic". If you understand Genesis, you will find that the Jewish Old Testament is the opposite of what Yahweh taught in Genesis. It was because Jesus understood Genesis and knew what the "teaching of Yahweh" was that he launched his attack on the Jewish group.
(5) Once the book of Genesis is understood, the whole Old Testament becomes clear. If one does not understand Genesis, one becomes a Judaizer and a lackey of "Satan's time". (6) It is difficult to read Genesis directly from the beginning, but if one understands the book of Revelation and becomes "the Christ who has eyes like a flame of fire, whose feet are like bright brass, whose voice is like the sound of many waters, whose right hand holds seven stars, whose mouth has a two-edged sword, whose face shines like a blazing sun, who hates the Nicolaitans, and who has a rod of iron", then it is much easier to read Genesis. It is much easier to look at Genesis and see which passages in the New Testament were added by the devil's group and not by the "disciples of Jesus", because the devil's group added the same farce and tone as the "Jewish priests" in the Old Testament.
(7) 1 Samuel 2:12 The two sons of Eli were wicked men, and did not know the Lord. 2:34 (Eli) Let what has happened to your two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, be a proof to you: they shall both die together one day. 8:1 When Samuel was old, he made his son a teacher of Israel. 8:3 His son did not walk in his ways, but was greedy for gain, and took bribes, and abused righteousness. 8:4 All the elders of Israel gathered together and came to Samuel at Ramah, 8:5 and said to him, "You are old, and your son has not done your will. Now make for us a king to rule over us, as the nations have done." 8:6 Samuel was not pleased with their saying, "Make a king over us," and he prayed to the LORD. 8:19 The people refused to listen to Samuel, saying, "Otherwise, we will have a king over us, 8:20 so that we may be like the nations, with a king over us, ruling over us and fighting for us. warfare." (8) "Samuel" was the priest who lost the crown of the Jewish "pope of church and state", and from "Samuel" onwards the Jews had their first king, after which The conflict between "kings and priests" followed Israel throughout. (9) In Old Testament times, it was not the "kings" who recorded history, but the "priests" who held a "hatred of power-grabbing" against the "kings (9) In "Old Testament" times, it was not the "kings" who recorded history, but the "priests" who held a "hatred of power-grabbing" against the "kings", so that the "kings" under the "priests" had a "moisture "It is inevitable that the "kings" appear in the Old Testament according to the likes and dislikes of the "priests". In other words, the kings in the Old Testament are not true and complete versions of themselves, but are shaped by the priests according to their preferences. (10) We can see in the Old Testament that the kings were all puppets of the "priests to promote edification", and that the kings were also guilty of some disgraceful acts, which were all false accusations and insults used by the "priests" to vent their "hatred for the seizure of power" against the kings. These were the false accusations and insults of the "priests" who were venting their "hatred of power" against the king. The Psalms and Proverbs in the Old Testament were all written by "priests", with the addition of the names "David and Solomon". Such cases abound.

Original text
1:1 After the death of Saul, David returned from slaying the Amalekites and stayed in Ziggurat for two days.
1:2 On the third day a man came out of Saul's camp, with his clothes torn and his head covered with dust, and came to David and bowed down before him.
1:3 David asked him, "Where have you come from?" He said, "I have fled from the camp of Israel."
1:4 David asked him again, "How are things? Please tell me." He answered, "The people fled from the line, and many fell down and died, Saul and Jonathan his son."
1:5 David asked the young man who reported the news, "How do you know that Saul and Jonathan his son are dead?"
1:6 The young man who reported the news said, "I happened to go to Mount Gilboa and saw Saul lying on his gun, with chariots and horsemen in hot pursuit of him.
1:7 When he turned back and saw me, he called to me. I said, 'Here I am.'
1:8 He asked me, 'What are you?' I said, 'I am an Amalekite.'
1:9 He said, 'Please come and kill me, for pain has taken hold of me, and my life is still alive.'
1:10 Surely I knew that he would not live when he fell, so I went and killed him, and brought the crown from his head and the bracelets from his arm to my Lord."
1:11 Then David tore his clothes, and so did those who followed him.
1:12 And they mourned and wept and fasted into the night, because Saul and Jonathan his son, and the house of Israel, the LORD's people, had fallen by the sword.
1:13 David asked the young man who reported the news, "Where are you from?" He said, "I am the son of Amalek's guest."
1:14 David said, "How is it that you do not fear when you stretch out your hand to kill the LORD's anointed one?"
1:15 David called a young man to him and said, "Go and kill him!"
1:16 David said to him, "Take the guilt of shedding human blood on your own head, for you testified with your own mouth, saying, 'I have killed the LORD's anointed.'" And the young men killed him.
1:17 And David made a lamentation, and hanged Saul and Jonathan his son
1:18 and commanded that the song be taught to the men of Judah. The song was called the song of the bow, and it was written in the book of Jashael.
1:19 It says, "O Israel, your honoured one was slain on the mountain. How could a great hero die!
1:20 Do not report it in Gath, and do not proclaim it in the streets of Ashkelon; lest the women of Philistia rejoice, and the women of the uncircumcised boast.
1:21 O Mount Gilboa, may there be no rain there, and may there be no produce in your fields for an offering! For there the shield of the hero is defiled and cast away. The shield of Saul, as if it had not been anointed.
1:22 Jonathan's bow and arrows did not retreat until the blood of his enemies was shed; Saul's sword did not retract until the oil of the warrior was cut out.
1:23 Saul and Jonathan loved each other while they lived, and did not part when they died. They were swifter than eagles and stronger than lions.
1:24 Cry out for Saul, O women of Israel! He has clothed you in vermilion beauty, and made your garments adorned with gold.
1:25 How could a hero fall in battle! How could Jonathan be slain on a mountain!
1:26 My brother Jonathan, I grieve for you! I am very glad for you! Your love for me is more wonderful than the love of women.
1:27 How could a hero fall! How could the instruments of war be destroyed!"

Expository part.
2 Samuel 1 David hears the bad news about Mount Gilboa (1:1-16)
10-1:1, (1) "1:1 After the death of Saul, David returned from slaying the Amalekites and stayed in Zechariah for two days": Q. Is this true? (2) "1:2 On the third day a man came out of Saul's camp, with his clothes torn and his head covered with dust, and came to David and bowed down before him": Q: Is that so? Answer: (1) Yes. (2) Yes.
10-1:9, (1) "1:9 Come and slay me, for pain has taken hold of me, and my life remains": Q: Is this what "Saul" said? (2) "1:10 Knowing that he will not live when he falls, I will go and kill him and bring the crown from his head and the bracelets from his arm to my Lord": Q: Is this what Saul said? Answer: (1) It was not "Saul" who said it, it was a lie. (2) It was a lie. He stole the "crown from Saul's camp".
10-1:11, "1:11 So David tore his clothes, and so did those who followed him. 1:12 And he mourned and wept and fasted into the night, because Saul and Jonathan his son and the LORD's people, the house of Israel, had fallen by the sword", Q. Is this true? Why did they "tear their clothes"? Answer: (1) They did not eat because they had no appetite because they had mourned too much for those who had died. (2) The "tearing of clothes" was an expression of anger at the killing.

10-1:13, (1) "1:13 David asked the young man who reported the news, "Where are you from? He said, I am the son of a guest of Amalek": Q: Is that so? (2) "1:14 And David said, How is it that you do not fear when you stretch out your hand to kill the LORD's anointed one?" : Q: Is that so? (3) "1:15 And David said to him, Take upon yourself the guilt of shedding human blood, because you testify with your own mouth, saying, I have killed the LORD's anointed" : Q: Is that so? Answer: Yes. Is. Is.
10-1:15-16, [Explanation of the "Devotional Version:] (1) "1:15-16 Saul was David's enemy; why did David still hold the man who killed the king guilty? Because he believed that God had anointed Saul to be king, and that God alone could remove him from the throne". (2) "It was God's work, not David's, to punish Saul for his sin", Q. Is this true? (3) "We must know that God has set up rulers over us and that it is right to respect their position". Is it true that the "priests" (priests and ministers) are "double standard and two-faced" and that they are right in whatever they say? Answer: (1) Because the wise "David" saw the flaw and knew that he was telling a lie. It was not at all true that "he believed that God had anointed Saul king, and that only God could remove him from the throne". (2) "It was God's work, not David's, to punish Saul for his sins", do you see? All the "priests" (priests and ministers) from ancient times to the present day think the same way, which means that they are all demons in the guise of "Christ". (3) The "priests" (priests and ministers) have always had a "double standard, two faces", they say whatever is right, they "cheat and steal" in accordance with the will of God.

2 Samuel 1: Lamentations for Saul and Jonathan (1:17-27)
10-1:17, (1) "1:17 David made a song of lamentation for Saul and Jonathan his son, 1:18 and commanded that it be taught to the men of Judah. The song is called the song of the bow, and it is written in the book of Jashael", Q: Is this true? (2) "1:19 The song says, "O Israel, your glorious one was slain on the mountain. 1:20 Do not report it in Gath, and do not preach it in the streets of Ashkelon; lest the women of Philistia rejoice, and the women of the uncircumcised boast. 1:21 O Mount Gilboa, may there be no rain for you there, and may there be no produce for your fields to offer! For there the shield of the hero is defiled and cast away. The shield of Saul, as if it had not been anointed. John 1:22 The bow of Nathan will not retreat until the blood of his enemies is shed, and the sword of Saul will not withdraw until the oil of a warrior is cut off. 1:23 Saul and Jonathan loved each other while they lived, and will not be separated when they die. They were swifter than eagles and stronger than lions. 1:24 Cry out for Saul, O women of Israel! He has clothed you in vermilion, and adorned your garments with gold. 1:25 How could a hero fall in battle! 1:26 My brother Jonathan, I grieve for you! I am very glad for you! Your love for me is more wonderful than the love of a woman. 1:27 How could a hero fall! How could the instruments of war perish? Q: Did David write this? Answer: (1) The first half was written by David and the second half by the author of 2 Samuel. (2) In 1 Samuel, the "priests" (priest, pastor) portrayed "Saul" as a "rebel against God", but here he is identified by "David" as a "rebel against God". The fact that "David" is identified as a "great hero" shows that "David and the priests" are two very different people. "Was David also slandered by the "priests" later on? Answer: Yes.

10-1:17-27, [Explanation of the "devotional version:] "1:17-27 Saul had caused David much suffering, but after his death and that of his sons, David continued to write songs of lamentation for them. David had good reason to hate Saul, but he did not resent or be angry, preferring to hide the evil and promote the good, admiring Saul's virtue and not caring about his attacks on him": (1) The attitude of "David" is the opposite of that of the "priests" (priests, ministers). (1) The attitude of "David" was the opposite of that of the "priests" (priests, ministers). (2) From "Samuel the priest", to the author of 1 Samuel, to the contributors to today's "devotional edition", there is not a single sentence in which they "They are all expressing their discontent with Saul's disobedience to the "priests" (God), and there is not a single sentence that does not take into account Saul's "Saul's disrespectful remarks to God were not ignored, for Saul had put an end to Israel's "united papacy" and made the "priests" a dictator. Saul had offended all the "priests" after Saul, who had become a "priestly group, a church group" that had seized power. Saul became the public enemy of the "priestly and ecclesiastical groups" who seized power.
