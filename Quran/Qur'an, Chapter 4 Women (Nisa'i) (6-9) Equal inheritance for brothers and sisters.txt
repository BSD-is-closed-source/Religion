The True Qur'an, Chapter 4 (6) Attitude towards orphans without parents
6. "Test the orphans until they reach marriageable age, and when you see that they are able to handle their property, return it to them, and do not wastefully consume it before they are old enough. The rich guardians should be honest and self-controlled; the poor guardians may take a reasonable living. And when you return their property to them, let someone bear witness to it. Allah is sufficient as a watcher." : (1) You should give orphans a mature mind and a wide experience of life through various trials until they reach marriageable age. And when you see that they are wise and experienced enough to handle property, return their property to them. Do not wastefully consume their property before they are old enough, for this is theft and robbery that only robbers do, and you will be punished by God. (2) The rich guardians should keep themselves clean and not take payment from the orphans. A poor guardian may receive a reasonable amount of money from his property for his maintenance. (3) When you return the property of the orphans to them, ask someone to testify that you are a good and honest man, and not a bad man who has taken by force, so that witnesses who know the truth may testify. Allah is sufficient to be your watcher.

The True Qur'an, Chapter 4 (7) Equal inheritance for brothers and sisters
7. "A man shall have a portion of the inheritance of his parents and of his next of kin, and a woman shall have a portion of the inheritance of her parents and of her next of kin, and each shall have her lawful portion of their inheritance, whatever the amount of their inheritance." (1) "A man shall be entitled to a portion of the property of his parents and next of kin, and a woman to a portion of the property of her parents and next of kin", which is a provision for "equal inheritance between men and women" within the family. (2) All brothers and sisters are entitled to an equal share of their inheritance, regardless of the size of their parents' and next-of-kin's inheritance, and each is entitled to their legal share.

Chapter 4 (8) of the Holy Qur'an
8. "If there are relatives, orphans, or paupers present at the time of the division, give them a portion of your inheritance and speak to them in a gentle manner." (1) A division of property, also known as an analysis of property, is a division of the common property by agreement between the co-owners of the property, according to certain criteria, and the division of the common property among the co-owners. The division of property generally occurs in the case of a division of an extended family or in the case of a divorce of a couple. (2) In the event of the death of a relatively wealthy person, if there are relatives, orphans or paupers present, you should give them a portion of your inheritance and speak gently to them. And if he had not much property during his lifetime, you may be flexible in dealing with those who are present during the division of his property.

The True Qur'an, Chapter 4 (9) Words and Actions for the Dying Patient
9. "And if one leaves behind oneself young and weak offspring, one grieves for them; and such, too, should grieve for the orphans of others, and should fear Allah, and should speak justly to the terminally ill." : (1) If one bequeaths young and weak descendants, one will grieve for their inability to live on their own. (2) Those who grieve over the inability of their young and weak offspring to take care of themselves should also grieve over the orphans of others, so they should treat them as they treat their own children. The fear of God is achieved through the practical act of compassion for the weak and the poor. (3) Speaking the legitimate truth to a dying patient, not telling lies to deceive him in order to make him temporarily happy, not letting him worry about the future of his family, and making him feel the warmth of human kindness on earth.
