The True Qur'an, Chapter 4 (15) Dealing with women who commit scandalous and evil deeds
15. "And if your women commit scandal, seek four witnesses from among your men; and if they have testified, then you shall detain them in your houses until they die, or Allah will make a way out for them." : (1) Lawful sexual relations between a man and a woman are not "scandalous or evil". If a man and a woman have illicit sexual relations with each other, they are committing scandal and adultery. (2) If your women commit scandal, you should rebuke them both; if they repent of their sins, you should forgive them both. If your women do not repent of their sins, so that they can seek four people who are willing to testify to their scandalous deeds, it means that she has gained a bad reputation and has reached the point of corruption and has become a notorious devil, so you should detain them in your homes until they die, and never let such a devil corrupt the glory of Islam. (3) After a period of compulsory isolation, if she does repent of her sins, perhaps Allah will open a way out for them.
(16) And Allah is Forgiving, Merciful to those who repent of their sins.
16. "And if your men commit scandal, rebuke them both, but if they repent, forgive them both. Indeed, Allah is the Forgiving, the Merciful." : (1) Allah is not forgiving and merciful to everyone, but only to those who repent of their sins. (2) Allah is not Forgiving and Merciful to those who do not repent of their sins.
The Qur'an, Chapter 4 (17) Forgiveness is only for those who repent of their sins soon after they have committed them.
17. "Allah forgives only those who do evil in ignorance and repent of their sins soon afterwards; such are those whom Allah will forgive. Allah is All-Knowing, Most Wise." (1) Those who do evil out of ignorance for a moment and then repent of their sins soon after they feel that they have done wrong, only such people will be forgiven by Allah. (2) If one commits evil many times out of ignorance, so that he becomes accustomed to it and has no sense of repentance at all, such a person will not be forgiven. (3) And whoever is ignorant and repents of his sins soon after committing them, and whoever is accustomed to committing them without any sense of repentance, Allah is All-Knowing and Wise.
The Qur'an, Chapter 4 (18) Do not say, "Now I have indeed repented of my sins," until you are on your deathbed.
18. "He who has done evil all his life and is dying and says, "Now I have indeed repented of my sins, is not forgiven; nor is he who is dying and does not believe forgiven. For such We have prepared for them a painful punishment." (1) "He who has done evil all his life and is dying says, Now I have indeed repented of my sins, but am not forgiven" because he has not shown those around him how he repented of his sins and he has not had the effect of teaching the world to turn from evil to good, so he has no merit and cannot make up for his mistakes, and therefore "is not forgiven (2) "A man who has done evil for a lifetime". (2) "Those who have been evil all their lives and who say only at their death: Now I have indeed repented of my sins" have repented too late, and Allah has prepared for them a painful punishment.
